Current statistical practice is to look at a few models
Example of current statistical practice (scikit)
This silently fails
Andrew Gelman says we should use a language of models
   - automaticall testing and expanding models
We build an open-ended language of GP regression models
   - it structure allows us to automaticall summarize them
Example automatically generated summary - we'll show you how this was possible
Defining a language of models seems hard - but can just do sums and products of kernels
example sums and products
table of special cases
example search
sums and distributivity
Examples - but can you see pattern?
'kernels modify functions in consistent ways' - adjectives - examples
complete example reports
model checking
so this is kind of nice


shitty - slow, doesn't work with many features, hard to use, takes the fun out modeling, automates our jobs

directions
- fast AND easy-to-use ($$$)
- model-checking-stats version (gets stats faculty jobs)
- fancy ML version (get ML faculty jobs)
